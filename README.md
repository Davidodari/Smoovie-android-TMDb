Smoovie is an Android app Querying TMDb API to provide information on popular, trending, upcoming movies
with an option of saving ones favourite movies in a wishlist.

#### Prerequisites
 
 1. **Obtain Key**
 
 Create an account with TMDB to obtain an API key.
 
 2. **Configure gradle.properties**
 
 Once you have your TMDB key,you will need to add it to a global ```gradle.properties``` file so as not to add it to
 version control and expose your key and configure the projects app module build.gradle to reflect the name you gave your
 API Key.
 To Access the global ```gradle.properties``` ,Locate the `.gradle` file in the following directory
 
  > Windows: C:\Users\<Your Username>\.gradle
  
  > Mac: /Users/<Your Username>/.gradle
  
  > Linux: /home/<Your Username>/.gradle 
 
 If it doesn't exist create one and add in your API key like so
 
 ```properties
 PROJECT_API_KEY=API_KEY_VALUE
 ```
 
 3. **Configure build.gradle**
 
 Then In the `app` module build.gradle add the following function under defaultconfig/release/debug closures depending on your preference
 to have access to the API key.
 
 ```groovy
 
  buildConfigField("String", "API_KEY", "\"${project.hasProperty("SMOOVIE_API_KEY") ? SMOOVIE_API_KEY : System.getenv("SMOOVIE_API_KEY")}\"")
 
  ```
